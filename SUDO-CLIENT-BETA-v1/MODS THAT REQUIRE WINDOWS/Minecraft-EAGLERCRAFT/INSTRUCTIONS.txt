I kinda blue balled this so it might not work. 
(YOU NEED TO DO THE WINDOWS CRACK FIRST)
Tell me if it doesnt and i will add it to be fixed in BETA v2.
If it doesnt it most likely cant be fixed without installing windows 10 or tiny 11.
Eaglercraft (Actual Download for more FPS) runs on Java 8 and 11+.
ユアボイセンパイ®#0018 if it doesnt work.

Run SKlauncher 3.0.jar.
If you have an actual minecraft account you can try to log into it to play actual servers.
